The Health Data Manifesto
=========================

We are uncovering better ways to making digital health data more clinically useful by doing it and helping others. Through this work we have come to value:

**Transparency And Clarity** over ambiguity and obscurity.

**Open Community Collaboration** over top-down standardization.

**Extensible frameworks** over static standards.

**Simplicity** over complexity.

**Rough Consensus And Running Code** over bureaucratic black boxes

**Utility For Patients And Clinicians Today** over building the perfect system without feedback

**Patient-Centered Data** over clinician-centered data

We value the items more on the left than on the right.
